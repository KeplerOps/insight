# Design: Cline Development Process Tools

## Overview

This MCP server will enhance Cline's capabilities by automating the software development process workflow defined in GOAL_STATE.md using the prompts from PROMPTS.md. The server will provide tools that can be naturally invoked during development conversations, manage process artifacts, and ensure quality through systematic gates and checks.

## Core Components

### 1. Process State Manager

Tracks the current phase of development and maintains context across the development lifecycle.

#### Responsibilities
- Track current development phase (concept, requirements, design, etc.)
- Maintain context and history of decisions
- Store and manage process artifacts
- Track gate assessments and scores

#### Implementation
```typescript
interface ProcessState {
  phase: DevelopmentPhase;
  context: {
    concept?: ConceptBrief;
    requirements?: RequirementsDoc;
    design?: DesignDoc;
    tests?: TestSuite;
    implementation?: Implementation;
  };
  artifacts: Map<string, string>; // path -> content
  gateScores: Map<string, Assessment[]>;
}
```

### 2. Tools

#### 2.1 Concept Assessment
Evaluates concept readiness using expert prompts.

```typescript
interface ConceptAssessmentTool {
  input: {};  // No input needed, uses current process state
  output: {
    scores: {
      clarity: number;
      understanding: number;
      goalAlignment: number;
      readiness: number;
    };
    explanation: string;
    recommendations?: string[];
  }
}
```

#### 2.2 Brief Generation
Creates structured product briefs from discussions.

```typescript
interface BriefGenerationTool {
  input: {};  // Uses conversation history from process state
  output: {
    brief: {
      problemStatement: string;
      valueProposition: string;
      successCriteria: string[];
      constraints: string[];
    };
    filePath: string;  // Where the brief was saved
  }
}
```

#### 2.3 Requirements Generation
Creates formal requirements documents.

```typescript
interface RequirementsGenerationTool {
  input: {
    format?: "markdown" | "pdf";  // Optional output format
  };
  output: {
    requirements: {
      sections: {
        title: string;
        content: string;
        subsections?: Section[];
      }[];
    };
    filePath: string;
  }
}
```

#### 2.4 Requirements Assessment
Evaluates requirements quality and completeness.

```typescript
interface RequirementsAssessmentTool {
  input: {};  // Uses requirements from process state
  output: {
    scores: {
      clarity: number;
      completeness: number;
      consistency: number;
      implementability: number;
    };
    issues: {
      severity: "high" | "medium" | "low";
      description: string;
      recommendation: string;
    }[];
  }
}
```

### 3. Resources

#### 3.1 Process Templates
```typescript
interface ProcessTemplates {
  conceptBrief: string;
  requirementsDoc: string;
  designDoc: string;
  testPlan: string;
}
```

#### 3.2 Quality Gates
```typescript
interface QualityGate {
  name: string;
  criteria: {
    metric: string;
    threshold: number;
    weight: number;
  }[];
  assessmentPrompt: string;
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Natural Language Triggers

The server will recognize natural language cues in conversations to suggest or invoke appropriate tools:

- "Is this concept ready?" -> Concept Assessment
- "Create a brief from our discussion" -> Brief Generation
- "Let's write requirements" -> Requirements Generation
- "Are these requirements good enough?" -> Requirements Assessment

### 2. File Management

- Automatically create and update process artifacts in the project structure
- Maintain version history of documents
- Generate standardized filenames and paths

### 3. Quality Gates

- Integrate with the development workflow to enforce quality gates
- Track and persist gate scores
- Provide clear feedback on gate failures
- Guide users to address quality issues

## Implementation Plan

1. Core Infrastructure
   - Set up TypeScript project with MCP SDK
   - Implement ProcessState management
   - Create file management utilities

2. Tool Implementation
   - Implement each tool one at a time
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Include detailed logging

3. Integration Features
   - Add natural language recognition
   - Implement quality gates
   - Create process guidance system

4. Testing & Documentation
   - Unit tests for each component
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - User documentation
   - Example workflows

## Security Considerations

1. File Access
   - Only access files within project scope
   - Validate all file paths
   - Maintain audit logs

2. Process State
   - Persist state securely
   - Validate state transitions
   - Handle concurrent access

3. Quality Gates
   - Prevent gate bypassing
   - Secure assessment records
   - Validate gate criteria

## Future Enhancements

1. Additional Tools
   - Design assessment
   - Test coverage analysis
   - Implementation quality checks

2. Process Improvements
   - Machine learning for better prompt timing
   - Automated quality improvement suggestions
   - Historical analysis of development patterns

3. Integration Expansions
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Project management tool integration
   - Team collaboration features
